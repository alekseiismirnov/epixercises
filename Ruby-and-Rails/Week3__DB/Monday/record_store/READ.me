Artist Class and Many-to-Many
=============================

https://scrn.li/2bvJMq7KxQ94ky

We do not need to build a class for our join table. 

Artist class should include the following methods (along with tests): 
- .all(), 
- .clear(), 
= .find(), 
- #save(), 
- #update(),
- #== and 
- #delete()


- Association will be made via the Album#update() method.
- We need to create an Artist#albums() method.
