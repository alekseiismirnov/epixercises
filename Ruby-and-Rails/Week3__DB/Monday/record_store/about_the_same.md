Consider to Merge
=================

Database Level
--------------

[] Artist#add_artist & Album#add_album

* They do virtually the same.  
* There is a task for refactor them.
* Both are private, I can even rename them.

Contra:

* Should be definded in a separate lib.
  Probably it's a good idea, to make separate db layer, but I don't asked.

Methaprogramming or So
----------------------

* CRUD functionality for classes.
* Relations: one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one.
* CRUD routes generation. Seems to be dependent on previous two.
