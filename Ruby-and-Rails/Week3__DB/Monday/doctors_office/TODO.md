# Doctor's Office #

## Overview ##

This program is for office administrators to track patients in a doctor's office.

Here are some user stories to get started:

- [ ] As an administrator, I want to add a doctor to the database with a name and specialty.
- [ ] As an administrator, I want to add a patient with their name and birthdate.
- [ ] As an administrator, I want to be able to assign a patient to a doctor for care. \
      (Hint: Doctors will have a **one-to-many** relationship with their patients.)
- [ ] As a doctor, I want to see the list of patients that have been assigned to me.

Now the doctor's office has been grown to include many doctors with the same specialty.
The doctors have organized themselves into specialty groups.

- [ ] So when an administrator wants to enter a doctor,
      they must first select a specialty group and then add a doctor.

- [ ] As a patient, I want to see a list of all the doctors in a particular specialty. A doctor will only have one specialty.
(Hint: change from storing specialty as a column to making a specialties table.)

- [ ] As an administrator, I want to view an alphabetical list of doctors 
      including the number of patients they see. 
      (Hint: Do some online research for SQL ORDERing and COUNTing.)

## Required ##

- [x] Database - simple shell script
- [ ] General class for models - might be challanging, see charter
      **Just to see, what will happen** Use all-strings results from DB.exec, as argument for 
	constructors and do all conversion inside of them. 
- [ ] Tests for classes and classes iself - m.b. would be no need to test REST functionality, having tested generall class and integration test
- [ ] Integration tests - done, if we make all stubs
- [ ] Views and routes - seems, done at the end

### Databse ###

- [x] Tables for text and production
  - **doctors**: name, speciality
  - **patients**: name, birthdate, id_doctor

### General class for models ###

We can define operations for the list of fields and name of the table, all as symbols, stored in the class variables.  Descendanses can provide their own.

It seems there will be problem with operation with the related models.

Also, f.e. for the == operation we need to find out how to refer on members with their names given as symbols.

- [x] #save
- [x] .find
- [ ] == we'll not compare id's
- [ ] .search
- [ ] #update
- [ ] #delete
- [ ] #add another_model
