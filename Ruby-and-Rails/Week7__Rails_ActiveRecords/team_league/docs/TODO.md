# Team League #

Create an app to manage a league with teams and tournaments.

## Scenarios ##

- [ ] As the *league manager*, I want to add, update, delete and list **teams**.

- [ ] As the *league manager*, I want each **team** to have a **team coordinator** so I have a single point of contact for that team.

- [ ] As the *team coordinator*, I want to add, update, delete and list **players** on my team so I can keep track of who is currently on it.

## Further Exploration ##

- [ ] As the *league manager*, I want to set up **games** between teams so I can keep track of *scores* and *win-loss records*.

- [ ] As the *league manager*, I want to generate a **tournament** that pits the top **teams** against each other based on their **records**.

(Hint: Pick an even number like 8 or 16 so every team in the tournament always has a match.)
