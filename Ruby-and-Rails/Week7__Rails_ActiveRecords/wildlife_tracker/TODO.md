# Wildlife Tracker #

To build an app so that the rangers can report wildlife sightings.

- [x] Start out by letting users CRUD/L (create, read, update, destroy, list) animals.
  - [x] Model and migration
  - [x] Tests
  - [x] Views
- [x] Next, allow them to input a sighting of an animal, along with the date, latitude, and longitude. (Hint: an animal has many sightings.) Add CRUD functionality for these sightings.
  - [x] Model and migration
  - [x] Tests and views
    - [x] Create
    - [x] Retrieve (Within the animal page)
    - [x] Delete
- [ ] Now the area under consideration has been divided into several regions.
  - [x] Model and migration
  - [ ] Build out CRUD/L functionality for regions, and when a user reports a sighting, have them choose the region from a drop-down menu. (Hint: do a web search for html drop-down mdn.)
- [ ] Bonus: let users run reports to list all the sightings during a given time period.
- [ ] Extra Bonus: let users narrow their reports down to a particular region.
