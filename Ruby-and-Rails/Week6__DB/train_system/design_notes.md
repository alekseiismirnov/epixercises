## Tech Recommendations ##

- There is a many-to-many relationship between cities and trains.  ```Storable``` and ```Related``` lib seems to be a natural solution.
- When you list out the trains for a specific city, you'll need to start by selecting all stops for that city, and then selecting all trains for those stops.
